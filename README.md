# Defender
Used to keep raiders and unwanted users out of your discord servers. I used this tool to ban over 170 Users Total and it was all worth it.
This merges many wanted features such as GDDiscord's Evilpauze protocol (Which I have yet to complete and make fully operational)

## Features
- [ ] [EvilPauze](https://github.com/Alex1304/evilpauze) Lockdown Features 
- [x] Pruning Channel for Suspicious Alts/Joins
- [x] DiscordID Blacklists For Massbans
